It is generally advised to go with [Paper](https://papermc.io/), as it contains a lot of performance optimizations, exploit / bug fixes, is very easy to use (no BuildTools), and has a strong community maintaining it. Perhaps you’ve heard of a Paper fork such as Tuinity, Purpur, Yatopia, or others. Running forks such as Tuinity or Purpur are generally fine, as they’re maintained by two known contributors of Paper and usually don’t contain any game-breaking patches. However, you should always have backups and keep in mind that you’re usually on your own for support unless the fork you’re using has its own support Discord.

[Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity) is a Paper fork with the main focus being server performance. It can be seen as experimental, as a lot of Tuinity patches tend to be merged into Paper.

[Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/) is a Paper fork where the main focus is a feature-rich toolset. It contains many configurable gameplay changes that are deemed too game-changing to be included directly upstream into Paper.

Using any other fork that adds these things is not recommended. While attractive because of certain patches, the patches marketed are usually questionable, possibly impacting server performance or stability and aren’t up to Paper’s code standards. Use these forks at your own risk.
