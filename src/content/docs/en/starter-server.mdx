Starter Server is a repository that contains a basic Java Edition Minecraft server. The server here is not intended to
be the next Hypixel out of the box; instead, it should be seen as an easy way to get an up-to-date Minecraft server
quickly, to play with some friends in a home-hosted or at least self-hosted environment.

Since it's not intended to be fantastic or comprehensive, it contains just a few plugins:

- LuckPerms
- EssentialsX
- EssentialsXAntiBuild
- EssentialsXChat
- Vault
